# The Sock Exchange
This guided project was created for the Travelers Engineering Development Program (EDP) bootcamp.
It was developed in the form of varying labs teaching us how to use JavaScript, Git, GitHub, Agile, the MERN stack, PostgreSQL and more!

## Project Description
Welcome to The Sock Exchange - your one-stop-shop for reuniting lost soles!
Ever find yourself socked with a lonely leftie, or perhaps a solitary rightie, pining for its partner? 
Fear not, for The Sock Exchange is here to save the day (and your feet) from mismatched misery. 
Our innovative platform is dedicated to the noble cause of re-pairing the unpaired, ensuring that every sock finds its soulmate.
